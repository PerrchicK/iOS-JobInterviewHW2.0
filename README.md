# Candidate's HW Challenge 2.0
3 Years ago I made a [HW for candidates](https://github.com/PerrchicK/iOS-JobInterviewProject) as an interview process.
This time, I have got the chance to improve the previous implementation.

You can find here:
- Embedded in-app Google Map
- Find places nearby (and presented as UI Markers)
- Reverse geocoding (from coordinate to address)
- Address search with autocomplete (Google's API)
- Indexing people names autocomplete (My API) in Firebase database
- People name search using autocomplete (My API)
- From parking to driving detection
- Location sharing in Firebase database
