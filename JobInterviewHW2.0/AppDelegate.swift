/*
 Cool features:
 - iLeave - a behaviour that let's you open a navigation app on the hosting device (Waze / Google Maps) + let "everyone" know that a parking lot became available.
 - Use Firebase to sync nicknames + location
 - Implement an inside-data auto complete for nickname suggestions.
 Using of course the must have features to pass this test:
 - Reverse geocoding (from coordinate to address)
 
 - Throttler to throttle user input to prevent Google API "attacks"
 - Import an ObjC code to Swift, why? Still don't know why, just for fun.
 - My own component, Synchronizer, to present an end of a process (2 or 3 different concurrent subprocess)
 - Use the cool Response enum that Ron show you once
 - Pointer on function (don't know what for yet...)
