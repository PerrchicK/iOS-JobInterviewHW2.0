/*
 Cool features:
 - iLeave - a behaviour that let's you open a navigation app on the hosting device (Waze / Google Maps) + let "everyone" know that a parking lot became available.
 - Use Firebase to sync nicknames + location
 - Implemented an in-house auto complete for nickname suggestions.
 - Throttler to throttle user input and prevent Google API "attacks"
 - Import an ObjC code to Swift, for recognizing debug / release.
 - Used the cool Response enum that Ron showed me during the interview
 - A function pointer for quick behaviour change

 Using of course the mandatory features to pass this challenge:
 - Reverse geocoding (from coordinate to address)
 - Auto complete for addresses search
 - Usin Google Places web API.
 - User's current location and address
